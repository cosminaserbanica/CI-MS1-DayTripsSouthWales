## Introduction

This website was designed for a fictional, but potential travel business based in South Wales whose main objective is organising day trips to famous landmarks. The purpose of the website is to create an online presence, allowing customers to find information about the business and the services provided. 

This is the first Milestone Project a student must complete as part of the Web Applications Development Program at Code Institute.

The main requirements were to make a responsive and static responsive website with a minimum of three pages using primarily **HTML5** and **CSS3**.
